# Number guessing game!

The main file in this repo will do the following:
- Ask the player for their name with scanf()
- Generate a random number between 1-100
- Ask the player for a number input
- Comment on their input saying "too low", "too high", or "correct"
- On each input the program should increment a turn counter by 1
- When the player gets the number correct, the game will comment on their performance
